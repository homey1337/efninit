uinit alpha

boots your computer; no frills!

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

$ make
$ make install

edit your bootloader to add 'init=/etc/uinit.d/init' to the kernel command
line

edit startup, task, and shutdown to fit your desires

startup is run once, at startup. similarly, shutdown is run once when the
system is shut down. (duh.)

task is run and respawned as needed so the computer keeps doing something.

HOW TO USE IT

reboot.

when you are done, you can hit Ctrl+Alt+Del to reboot. alternatively, you
can send SIGINT to process 1. if you would rather poweroff, hit process 1
with a SIGUSR1.

that's all folks.
