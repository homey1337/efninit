uinit alpha

boots your computer; no frills!

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

$ make
$ make install

edit your bootloader to add 'init=/etc/uinit.d/init' to the kernel command
line

edit startup, task, and shutdown to fit your desires

startup is run once, at startup. similarly, shutdown is run once when the
system is shut down. (duh.)

task is run and respawned as needed so the computer keeps doing something.

HOW TO USE IT

reboot.

when you are done, you can hit Ctrl+Alt+Del to reboot. alternatively, you
can send SIGINT to process 1. if you would rather poweroff, hit process 1
with a SIGUSR1.

that's all folks.

CUSTOMIZATION

init is incredibly simple; it runs /etc/uinit.d/sysinit, then restarts
/etc/uinit.d/task as long as it exits, and after being hit with SIGINT or
SIGUSR1 it runs /etc/uinit.d/sysfini.

the sysinit and sysfini programs are written in a pseudo-shell language and
compiled by make_sys_c.py into C programs for compilation.

sysinit and sysfini are written to be the bare minimum useful system
configuration. ideally, they work for you without being edited.

for everything else, they call /etc/uinit.d/startup and
/etc/uinit.d/shutdown (respectively) to do local customization. these two
files, and /etc/uinit.d/task, must be written by the user (empty files are
distributed with uinit, because something needs to be present).
